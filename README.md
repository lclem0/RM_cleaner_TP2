This report outlines the development of two robotic agents capable of mapping and cleaning
an environment using a simulated MiR 100 robot platform enhanced with a virtual vacuum cleaner
bar. The first agent goal is to build a complete map of the environment in the minimum time possible,
while the second agent should clean the generated environment efficiently.

It explains in detail how to run the ROS package for both the traversing and cleaning agent, as well as the obtained results.
